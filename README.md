# Repairshop-Manager

## Overview
Repairshop-Manager is an application designed to manage auto repair shop operations including work orders, invoices, inventory, and available auto parts/cars for sale. Initially, all data is planned to be stored locally on the machine, with future plans to implement a backend for database storage. This will enable multiple instances of the application to manage auto repair shops across different machines.

## Planned Features
- **Work Orders**: Create, update, and manage work orders for repairs and services.
- **Invoices**: Generate invoices for completed work orders and track payment status.
- **Inventory Management**: Keep track of inventory for auto parts and manage stock levels.
- **Sales Management**: Maintain a catalog of cars and auto parts available for sale.
- **Customer and Vehicle Information**: Store customer details and vehicle information for efficient work order creation and management.
- **VIN Decoder**: Automatically decode VINs (Vehicle Identification Numbers) in work orders for quick identification and retrieval of vehicle details.
- **Backend Integration**: Design and implement backend to support database storage.
- **Multi-machine Support**: Enable synchronization and simultaneous usage across different machines.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve user interface and experience based on feedback and usability testing.
